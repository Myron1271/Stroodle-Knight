how do you keep youngster interested and make them talk about this game with their friends?
1) Random chance to crit; just like in dnd, give the players a random chance to temporarily feel like a badass
and feel like they just swung a losing battle into an undeniable victory. This gives players something to brag about
with their friends and keeps excitement levels high!
2) A pool of random attack animations. Variety is the spice of life. Players will have a higher chance of coming
back to the trash can if they feel like there is a part of the game they haven't seen yet.
3) Monster waves. A big problem with the design in this game is that damage to the boss will feel almost
negligible (it needs to be balanced for huuundreds of players). To circumvent this and to make players feel like
they still have agency over the battle we can instead introduce multiple smaller health bars to chip down.
4) Damage numbers. Just like with point 3, floating damage numbers will introduce some much needed feedback to
the players inputs. Make the unnecessarily big as well (actual damage * 100), like in World of Warcraft.
